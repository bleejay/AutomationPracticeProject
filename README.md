# AutomationPracticeProject

## Project Aim
This project was created in order to test the website automationpractice.com. In order to do this the team 
has split our focus into user paths (using BDD practices) and applied scenario test cases using cucumber.
This will allow automated tests to be run using Selenium to enact specified user actions. The user actions we have
tested can be seen on https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/b4dd3bb3-b441-40a9-a8b7-4893d7b4d7a1 .
